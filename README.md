# Blogs API
The project is a RESTful API using the MVC architecture and Sequelize. The API is designed to manage a blog, where you can register as a user, create posts, log in, delete, update, and perform various other actions, all connected to the MySQL database. The management is handled by Express along with Sequelize, avoiding direct database write commands, providing more structure and reliability to the application.
